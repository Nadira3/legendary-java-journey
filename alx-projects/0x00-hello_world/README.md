# 0x00. Hello, World  

This directory contains introductory Java programs covering basic concepts such as compiling, printing output, and working with different file types.  

## Learning Objectives  

By completing these tasks, I will:  
- Understand how Java code is compiled and executed  
- Learn the structure of a basic Java program  
- Use `System.out.println` to print output to the console  
- Work with comments in Java  
- Understand the difference between `javac` (compiler) and `java` (interpreter)  
- Handle simple errors and debug basic syntax issues  

## Files
